                correctAnswer: "Before the last transaction",
                explanation: "If before images are used, the last transaction in the dump will not have updated the database prior to the dump being taken. The last transaction will not have updated the database and must be reprocessed. Program checkpoints are irrelevant in this situation."

                options: ["Document details on a change register", "Embed details within source code", "Standardize file naming conventions", "Utilize automated version control"],

                options: ["Patches are not tested before installation on critical servers", "Patches are in conflict with current licensing agreements", "Patches are not reflected in the configuration management database", "Patches are pushed from the vendor increasing Internet traffics"],
                correctAnswer: "Patches are not tested before installation on critical servers"

                question: "An IS auditor is observing transaction processing and notes that a high-priority update job ran out of sequence. What is the MOST significant risk from this observation?",
                options: ["Previous jobs may have failed", "The job may not have run to completion", "The job competes with invalid data", "Daily schedules may not be accurate"],

                question: "Which of the following would be the MOST significant audit finding when reviewing a point-of-sale (POS) system?",
                options: ["Customer credit card information is stored unencrypted on the local POS system", "An optical scanner is not used to read bar codes for the generation of sales invoices", "Frequent power outages occur, resulting in the manual preparation of invoices", "invoices recorded on the POS system are manually entered into an accounting application"],
                correctAnswer: "Customer credit card information is stored unencrypted on the local POS system",
                explanation: "It is important for the IS auditor to determine if any credit card information is stored on the local point-of-sale (POS) system. Any such information, if stored, should be encrypted or protected by other means to avoid the possibility of unauthorized disclosure. Manually inputting sale invoices into the accounting application is an operational issue, if the POS system were to be interfaced with the financial accounting application, the overall efficiency could be improved. The nonavailability of optical scanners to read bar codes of the products and power outages are operational issues."

                options: ["Business Intelligence Risk", "Privacy Risk", "Externality Risk", "Business Process Risk"],
                correctAnswer: "Externality Risk",
                explanation: "RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or collocated systems, assets, and people. RFID systems typically are not isolated from other systems and assets in the enterprise. Every connection point between the RFID system and something outside the RFID system represents a potential vulnerability for the entity on the other side of the connection, whether that is an application process, a valued asset, or a person. Externality risks are present for both the RF and enterprise subsystems of an RFID system. The main externality risk for the RF subsystem is hazards resulting from electromagnetic radiation, which could possibly range from adverse human health effects to ignition of combustible material, such as fuel or ordnance."

                options: ["save storage space", "increase processing efficiency", "ensure data integrity", "prevent loss of data"],
                correctAnswer: "increase processing efficiency"

                question: "Consider two tables, Orders and Customers. Orders has a CustomerID column that is a foreign key referencing the CustomerID in the Customers table. You need to delete a Customer record, but there are Orders referencing this customer. What is the result if you have defined the foreign key with ON DELETE RESTRICT?",
                options: ["The deletion of the Customer record will be allowed as long as there are no matching Orders", "The deletion of the Customer record will fail because of the foreign key reference", "The deletion of the Customer record will cause all related Orders to be set to NULL", "The Customer record will be deleted, and all related Orders will be deleted as well"],
                correctAnswer: "The deletion of the Customer record will fail because of the foreign key reference",
                explanation: "The specification of ON DELETE RESTRICT enforces referential integrity, hence preventing the record from being deleted."
            },
            {
                id: 14,
                question: "Suppose the foreign key relationship between Orders and Customers is defined with ON UPDATE CASCADE, and you update the primary key value in the parent table, what happens in the child table?",
                options: ["The child table values will be set to NULL because of the cascading update", "The child table values will be deleted to maintain data integrity", "The child table will throw an error, as updating a primary key is not allowed", "The foreign key values in the child table will be updated automatically to match the new primary key in the parent table"],
                correctAnswer: "The foreign key values in the child table will be updated automatically to match the new primary key in the parent table",
                explanation: "In a relational database, when a foreign key is defined with the ON UPDATE CASCADE option, it creates a cascading effect where any update to the primary key in the parent table is automatically reflected in the child table. This ensures that referential integrity is maintained across tables."
            },

                id: 15,
                question: "Consider a scenario where the foreign key relationship is between Orders (parent) and Customers (child), and the ON DELETE CASCADE option is set. What is a potential risk of using ON DELETE CASCADE in this scenario?",
                options: ["It may lead to accidental deletion of important customer records", "As a rule of referential integrity, it prevents any deletion from occurring, regardless of the setting", "It ensures that no other records are impacted when a customer record is deleted", "It guarantees that customer records are never deleted"],
                correctAnswer: "It may lead to accidental deletion of important customer records"
